## Why this?
[They fucked with the wrong person](https://tv.yarn.co/yarn-clip/b3d03c16-d240-43d2-9788-d14baa8d7690).

This is not free culture, this is piracy. 

If you publish a book or a movie for free after 1 year it's free culture, if you do the same after 1 day it's piracy.

On their website there are a ton of ads, shortlink and shit like this.

They say 'we love free culture'? Ok, **let's make culture free again without ads** :) (semi cit.)

## Usage
Just run this, script has a menu with digit like in the 80s, it's "a bit" easy-to-use.
```
# python main.py
```
